This is the project related to course ...

In this project I created a Tinder clone that uses NodeJS, MongoDB, React and Express. Users can like others by swiping right and after matching (in this case, users are matched by default if one swipes right) they are able to chat.
Users are also able to change their information on the site after creating their account. The website is designed in a responsive way and is usable on all modern screen sizes. The chat is scrollable in case the entire chat history does not fit on screen at once.
If the user is not logged in, only the home page is accessible. The login done using JWT and cookies. 

This project can be run using "npm run dev" in the root folder. This will start both the NodeJS backend and React frontend.
